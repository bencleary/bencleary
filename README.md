### Ben Cleary

**Technical Lead & Software Engineer** building production systems from zero to scale.

I architect distributed systems, lead engineering teams, and write code that solves real problems. My background spans geospatial data processing, industrial IoT, and cloud-native SaaS platforms.

#### What I Build

I specialize in building data-intensive applications and distributed systems:

- **Geospatial data pipelines** processing terabytes of LiDAR point clouds
- **Real-time IoT monitoring systems** handling continuous industrial telemetry
- **Multi-tenant SaaS platforms** with cloud-agnostic Kubernetes infrastructure
- **Time-series analytics** for industrial monitoring and anomaly detection

#### Technical Stack

**Primary:**
- Python (Django, FastAPI, pandas, numpy)
- TypeScript/JavaScript (VueJS, Node.js)
- PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB
- Docker, Kubernetes
- AWS, Azure

**Also work with:**
- Go (side projects, learning)
- Rust (open source contributions)
- Flutter (mobile applications)
- MQTT, Kafka (distributed messaging)
- Point cloud processing (LiDAR, geospatial analysis)

#### Featured Projects

##### [dtm-differ](https://github.com/bencleary/dtm-differ)
Python CLI and API for quantifying elevation change between digital terrain models. Processes massive point clouds, categorizes ground movement using configurable thresholds, and generates comprehensive analysis reports. Built for pipeline and infrastructure monitoring applications.

**Tech:** Python, NumPy, Click, FastAPI, pytest

##### [uploader](https://github.com/bencleary/uploader)
Secure file upload service in Go with encryption-at-rest, automatic preview generation, and S3-compatible storage. RESTful API with metadata database and support for both local and cloud storage backends.

**Tech:** Go, PostgreSQL, S3 API, encryption

##### django-timescaledb
Open-source Django database backend for TimescaleDB. Contributed custom model managers, time-series query optimizations, and comprehensive documentation. Used in production for IoT sensor data and industrial monitoring.

**Tech:** Python, Django, TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL

##### fluvio-client-python
Python client for Fluvio streaming platform. Co-authored smart module filtering feature enabling real-time data transformation in distributed streaming pipelines.

**Tech:** Python, Rust bindings, distributed systems

#### What I'm Working On

- Building geospatial data processing tools for infrastructure monitoring
- Exploring distributed systems patterns and real-time data pipelines
- Contributing to open source projects in the Python and Rust ecosystems

#### Open Source

I'm an active contributor to open source:
- **Moderator** of world's largest Django community (50,000+ members)
- **Contributor** to Fluvio, Django-TimescaleDB, and various geospatial libraries
- **Author** of technical articles on distributed systems and software architecture
